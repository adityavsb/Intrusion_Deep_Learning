# Classification based on Deep Learning Network on Intrusion Detection Dataset
- In this project, a multi-layer feed forward neural network has been used to claasify anomalies (attacks) on a dataset released by Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS). 
- The dataset can be accessed here: https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/australian-centre-for-cyber-security/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/
- Furthermore, DeepLearning4j framework has been used to implement the MLP using Java. First, you set up the whole maven project in Java and try running this basec example from Deeplearning4J framework: https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/feedforward/ classification/MLPClassifierSaturn.java
- After this, basic python codes have been used to perform data preprocessing and make it usable for deep learning. 
- Python codes for data pre processing have been provided along with the modified Java code for classification task.
